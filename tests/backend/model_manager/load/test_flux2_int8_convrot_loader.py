"""Loader-level tests for the `int8_tensorwise` FLUX.2 path.

These drive `Flux2CheckpointModel._load_from_singlefile` and assert the end state of the module:
which layers keep their codes, what the reconstructed weight is, and what the cache was asked to
free. The geometry is the released Klein 9B layout scaled down by 16 -- same module tree and the
same two fusions, 4 tensors per block instead of 4096-wide ones.

The branch this covers is one decision: an int8 layer ships a `.weight_scale` exactly like a scaled
fp8 layer, so a loader that probes for scales first takes the whole checkpoint down the fp8 path.
There the codes are scaled but never dequantized to a dtype torch computes in.
